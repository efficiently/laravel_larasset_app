// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/js, provider/assets/js,

// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear in whatever order it
// gets included (e.g. say you have require_tree . then the code will appear after all the directories
// but before any files alphabetically greater than 'app.js'
